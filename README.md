I worked on a data science project where I was responsible for collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to identify meaningful patterns and insights.
The task involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), applying suitable machine learning models, and interpreting the results to support decision-making.
I also visualized the findings to communicate them effectively to stakeholders.
